I’m a UK-based developer, who technically is an artist - I love shaping the moment-to-moment feel of games through gameplay systems, tools, and shaders that bring ideas to life.

My core experience is in C# and Unity games engine, but previously worked professionally with TypeScript, PixiJS, and GLSL shader language.

In my free time I work on numerous hobby projects, ranging from Shaders Vault to PixiJS Particle System. I frequently blog about my projects to capture my findings and share my knowledge.

## [Shader Vault](https://github.com/danielpokladek-shaders)

I originally started working with shaders during my undergraduate dissertation, and have since fallen in love with them. I enjoy spending my free time tinkering with new effects and bringing ideas to life.

Shader Vault is a collection of shaders I’ve worked on, spanning focused techniques like stencil shaders to fully realized effects, including my remake of the portal from Spyro: Reignited Trilogy.

## [PixiJS Particle System](https://github.com/danielpokladek/pixi-particle-system)

A modern, flexible particle system for PixiJS - a spiritual successor to the original particle emitter, but rebuilt with a clean TypeScript-first architecture and more expressive API.

I originally started working on this project alongside a PixiJS-based portfolio project, where I needed a particle system for several in-game effects. At the time, the original emitter package wasn’t compatible with the latest PixiJS version.

As the library grew and I introduced more personal improvements, it evolved beyond it’s original scope. I eventually decided to make it open-source and share it with the wider community.

## [Personal Website](https://www.danielpokladek.me/)

This website is built using the Hugo static site framework with the Blowfish theme, customized to suit my needs. I chose a static-site approach for its performance, simplicity, maintainability, and blogging integration.

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, with GitHub Actions handling automated builds and deployment. Every change is built and deployed through a lightweight CI pipeline, keeping the workflow fast, repeatable, and hands-off.
